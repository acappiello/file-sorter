===========

Status: Alpha

Description
-----------

A tool to organize files based on date/time metadata.

Status
------

Almost entirely untested. Use at your own risk. While file loss is
extraordinarily unlikely, I recommend only running in copy mode for now, in case
of unexpected output. It does what I needed it to, so don't expect frequent
updates.

Requires
--------

* Python 2.7 (Possibly others)

Python Modules
--------------

* Tkinter
